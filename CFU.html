        <div class="cfu-description">
          <p>For CFU 1 I created a new scene in Unity and added 3D objects
            like planes and cubes. I applied materials, used physics so
            the cubes could fall and tumble, and experimented with scaling
            and coordinates. One challenge I faced was adjusting the view
            and object rotation, but I improved with practice.</p>

          <p>In CFU 2 I imported the IntroToUnity package and all its assets
            into my Unity project. I opened the Playground scene to explore
            the setup and make sure everything loaded correctly. Then I
            imported the TextMeshPro (TMP) Essentials package so I could
            use text features in the scene.</p>

          <p>In CFU 3 I opened the Playground scene in Unity and practiced flying
            through the hoops in the Scene window. I recorded the screen while
            moving through each hoop to show control and navigation. It was fun
            to practice camera movement, though keeping a smooth path through
            all the hoops was a bit challenging at first.</p>

          <p>In CFU 4 I used the Scene view gizmo in Unity to change my view and
            explore the scene. I rotated and switched between different angles
            until I found the hidden word. I recorded the screen while doing this,
            and although it took a little time to line up the camera just right,
            it helped me understand how to control the view better.</p>

          <p>In CFU 5 I recorded myself adding a new object in Unity.
            I opened the Hierarchy, created a 3D cube, and placed it
            in the scene. It was simple to do, and I learned how easy
            it is to add and position new objects in Unity.</p>

          <p>In CFU 6 I recorded myself adding materials to objects in Unity.
            I created a new material, changed its color, and applied it to
            a cube and plane in the scene. It was interesting to see how
            materials change the look of objects and make the scene more
            colorful.</p>

          <p>In CFU 7 I recorded myself adding a Rigidbody component to a
            cube in Unity. I selected the cube, opened the Inspector,
            and added the Rigidbody so it could fall and react to gravity.
            It was cool to see the cube start moving naturally once I pressed Play.</p>

          <p>In CFU 8 I recorded myself adding more cubes in Unity and
            experimented with global and local coordinates. I moved
            and rotated the cubes using both coordinate systems to
            see how they affected the cube’s direction and alignment.
            It helped me understand how object movement works differently
            depending on which coordinate system I use.</p>

          <p>In CFU 9 I added a prefab game object to my Unity scene and
            took a screenshot of it in the Hierarchy and Scene view.
            It was easy to drag the prefab into the scene, and I could
            see how it kept all its original settings and components.
            This helped me understand how prefabs make it faster to
            add repeated objects or characters.</p>
